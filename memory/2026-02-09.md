### System Update: Cron Job Execution and Formatting
Completed the implementation of isolated cron jobs for the trading alert scanner and market data sync. The jobs are now successfully executing and reporting statuses independently of the main session. Tested and confirmed delivery of messages to WhatsApp.

**User Request:** User requested a prefix for all trading agent messages to distinguish them from other notifications. Decided on the format: `*[Trading-Agent]*` (bold/italic) as it is more compatible and visually distinct in WhatsApp.

**Manni Update:** 
- Optimized `trading/sync_hyperliquid.py` to fix an infinite loop bug where the script would spin if no new candles were available for a timeframe.
- Added exponential backoff handling for 429 (Rate Limit) errors from the Hyperliquid API.
- Executed the sync job. Encountered persistent rate limits towards the end of the run (DOGE, LINK, MATIC), suggesting a need for longer cooldowns between symbols.

**Next Steps:** Implement the formatting update in the `trading:alert_scan` cron job payload and test the new output format. Increase the sleep delay between symbols in `sync_hyperliquid.py` to avoid 429s.
